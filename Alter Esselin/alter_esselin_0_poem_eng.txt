Careful! Tread softly stranger,
Don't disturb my slumber.
It took all my strength to get here,
And I'm nameless as a number.
But should you feel the itch to know
Who is it that lies below
Open your album and jot this down:
"Here lies a poet with a kingly crown
Who died of drinking his own sweet brew--
Honeyed song that held arsenic too."
