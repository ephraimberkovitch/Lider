And even the butterfly--
Which is carefree
It seems to me--
Even he
Will tell you
That life is never easy.

Live an hour, or to eighty,
It's all mixup and suffering.
Easier by far is his last fluttering;
In that moment
Of reaching eternal content--
He seeks not even a grass pillow for his head
As a heavy raindrop strikes him dead.
