This project is the hopeful begining of an online database of Yiddish poetry. It aims to: 
(1) enrich the already substantial digital presence of Yiddish literature
(2) present Yiddish poetry in an interactive and provacative way by:
        (a) accompanying each poem wih a recorded reading of the Yiddish originals
        (b) offering the translation at the click of a button
        (c) supplying the author's relevant biographical information 
        (d) supplying relevant and specific contextual background
        (e) referencing sources for more reading and online exploration
        (f) providing visual aids to offer new insight or highlight the work's energy
        (g) offer lexicographic analysis tools to enrich (and possibly complicate) the study of this poetry
        
        As of yet all but (g) have been implemented in the available samples.
(3) embrace crowdsourcing as the main model of contribution to the databases corpora

If you clone this repository you can generate the HTML pages locally, on your own machine, by running the python script. But for now they are being hosted at www.columbia.edu/~rah2183/Lider/

I have no access to a server and so the analysis tools are at a standstill--I hope to implement them soon so that they can be run locally. 

The page layout: 
        -The left margin contains a photo relevant to the poem, or the poem's historical context, as well as a short text on the same theme.
        -The right margin contains a photo of the poet and a biogrpahical blurb.

        -The foot contains links to resources.

        -The center houses the poem and the recorded reading.

Any photo can be enlarged by clicking it. Every page has translation buttons to toggle between English and Yiddish. The main page allows you to browse the poems by year, poet, and poem. Click a Yiddish word and various queries are suggested to you--but these are inactive as yet. 

To Do:
-Caption for photos
-About page
-Button size/contrast?
-Implemented the analysis tools
-Have a search function
