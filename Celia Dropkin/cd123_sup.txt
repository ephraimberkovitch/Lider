This poem seems to stand out from Dropkin's other work because it avoids eroticisms and does not drill in the "instrospectivism" of the Di Inzikhistn. Yet, the imagery here is just as provactive--though without the sexual undertones (or overtones). Their absence is remarkable because the poem maintains the same tone as her more charged poems. Though "I" (or "zikh") does not ring strongly here, everything has taken on a human tint. 


Celia Dropkin was born in Bobruisk, White Russia, on December 5, 1887. In 1912, she moved to the United States. She became involved with the group of Yiddish poets that called themsleves Di Inzikhistn, The Introspectivists.

Her poetry is often explicitly erotic and bold and this sometimes contrasts with an underlying sensitivity and emotional nudity. She died on August 17, 1956.
