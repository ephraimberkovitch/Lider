Seeping from the cells of your skyscrapers
is golden honey—light
through millions of windows,
as through cells of gigantic honey-combs,
you can see golden honey,
human honey, light.
Immense bees built their beehives here, 
a forest of beehives,
and filled them until they overflowed with honey,
human honey—light.
The Hudson at night is black as pitch, 
and the honey flows
and swallows the pitch on the banks of New York.

These amazing trees with golden fruit,
a forest of golden fruit,
gigantic cedars
hung with lanterns.
