We have such plain faces
and talk quit ordinary talk;
the glow from our eyes is sober, 
our joy altogether commonplace.

When we go in to eat, we sit down 
in work clothes at the table set for us,
and when we bury someone close
it's on a day like any other.

Half asleep in the cold dawns, we hurry
to get under the whip on time,
and we drive away the young little poems
like the house dog who tries to come running along.
