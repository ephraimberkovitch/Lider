As a member of Di Yunge, Rolnik pursued the group's goal of finding beauty in
the mundane, the everyday (see his use of "<span dir="rtl">װאָכעדיק</span>").

In this poem he renders the poet an everyman--earthly and perhaps even boring,
banal. Yet he simultaneously imbues the everyday with a poetic charm and
warmth. 

Many of the Yunge toyed with this idea in different ways, often poeticizing
 the mundane and making it lofty. Here Rolnik manages to preserve the
humbleness of the poet while exhibiting their subtle beauty. 


Born in Zhukovich, a village in Minsk province , Byelorussia (Jewish
Lithuania), where his father rented a large water mill. Rolnik studied with a
private tutor and in the Mir yeshiva. From 1895 to 1898, he lived in Minsk.
Wrote poetry in Russian, Hebrew, and Yiddish. He immigrated to America in
1899, left in 1901 for England and Russia, and returned to the United States
for good in 1906. For many years, the poet worked as a proofreader on the
daily <em>Der Tod</em> ("The Day"). Often ill, he was in sanatoriums on
several occasions. Published Yiddish poetry with poets of the Young
Generation.
