The flames rage on, more and more
Hell awakes to the smoke amassed.
Try, push towards salvation's door— 
"No use, oh, no! It is shut fast."
 
They scream, they scramble, and they fall,
in the Devil's bloody dwelling.
They sink in his damned shriek, in thrall,
each exit blocked and unrelenting.

They run, but no one knows whither,
and their every hope comes to naught.
Too heavy is Hell's door hither,
oh, Ashmedai has jailed this lot.

"Don't curse Hell till your throat is sore!"
"Not worth the trouble—he is right..."
"But no! Let's try, lean on that door,
And all, as one, break it with might!"

They're captive to the Hellish blaze
while the lock, to t'Devil, stays true…
"Come everyone quick, your hands, raise!
Break the door, let freedom ensue…"

This Hell is only a hell whilst
the Devil's lock we don't resist.
Its flame is strong and perilous
if we let its door seal our abyss.
