The fire rages on, more and more
Smoke billows, flames stir Hell awake.
They push towards salvation's door, 
No use! It's closed for goodness sake!

They scream, they scramble, and they fall,
in the Devil's bloody dwelling.
They sink in his damned shriek, in thrall,
each exit blocked, unforgiving.

They run, but no one knows whither,
and their every hope comes to naught.
Too heavy is Hell's door hither,
oh, Ashmedai has jailed this lot.

The black demon stands no trial!
Not worth the trouble--he is right...
To that closed door there, so vile!..
And all, as one, break it with might!

They're captive to the Hellish blaze
while the lock, to t'Devil, stays true…
Come everyone quick, your hands, raise!
Break the door, let freedom ensue…

The Hell is only a hell whilst
the devil's lock sticks to its chore.
Perilous is its flame, its fist
only because of a locked door...
