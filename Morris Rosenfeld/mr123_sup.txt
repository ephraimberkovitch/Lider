Morris Rosenfeld had already firmly established himself as the voice of the proletariat and the face of the sweatshop poets by March 25, 1911, the day of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. It was therefore in his line of duty to publish a poem just a few days later in Forverts, mourning the loss of the many workers and protesting the evil of the workplace (and the deadly "locked door").

<span dir="ltr">The poem is subtitled "<span dir="rtl">פֿײַער־געדאַנקען איבער פֿאַרברענטע אַרבעטער </span>."</span>


Morris Rosenfeld was born in 1862 in Boksze in Russian Poland.

Around the age of twenty, as a tailor in London, Morris Rosenfeld began writing labor poems. At twenty-four he immigrated to the United States and become a devoted socialist as well as a presser in the sweatshops of the Lower East Side. He shaped the group of poets that came to be known as the Sweatshop Poets. Over ten thousand people attended his funeral in 1923.
